# Blog

<---Features--->

This is a blog I made as my first MVC project. This blog has posts, comments, and topics. You can search through the blog posts and add a comment if you're a registered user. Users can register using Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn. I use this blog to document my journey into the world of coding.


<---Download/Install Instructions--->

After dowloading/cloning this project to your local machine, open in Visual Studio 2015 Community or greater. Once open, update the references and NuGet packages. Then, open the package manager console and update the database (this will create a local database on your machine and seed in the demo admin). If you wish to create a custom admin login and password, open the Configuration.cs file in the Migrations folder and adjust the admin user information prior to updating the database. Once you have completed the above steps, this application will build and you can render it in the internet browser of your choice.
